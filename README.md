## Rest Browser

A browser client for REST APIs, designed to be embedded in the API itself.

### Usage

1. Save the contents of [public/squashed.html](public/squashed.html)

2. Make API requests from browsers return this HTML (you might want to use [content negotation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation)).

3. Now your API has a handy little browser client embedded into it, like this:
